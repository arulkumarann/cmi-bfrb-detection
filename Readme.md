### To Do
-Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing (inspect sensor signals, clean/normalize, encode labels)

-Baseline Model (feature extraction + Random Forest with evaluation)

-Advanced Model (sequence model like LSTM/1D CNN for improvement)

-Submission Pipeline (script to generate submission.csv in correct format)

-Documentation & Results (README, metrics, plots, summary of findings)
